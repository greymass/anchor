The staking power coming from the EOS that is exchanged for REX will then be lent to users that in exchange will pay a small fee increasing the size of the fund. Because the amount of REX is finite, the result is that the EOS to REX ratio can only go up meaning that whoever lends their EOS to the fund will at least recover the entirety of those funds, but can almost always expect a return.\n\n",
