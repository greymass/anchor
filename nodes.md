## API Node Recommendations

`eos-voter` is a light wallet, which means it relies on an external API node connected to the EOS blockchain network in order to function.

The list below contains EOS API nodes run by members of the EOS community that you can choose from.

### Privacy

Even though your keys never leave the `eos-voter` applications, the API node you connect to can still reveal personally identifiable information about you. This information may include:

- Account Names
- IP Addresses

If you are concerned about revealing this information to any of these 3rd party API nodes, it is recommended you run your own API Node and connect to that.
